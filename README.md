# DVORAK with Arabic Romanization Keyboard Layout
 Trying to make a DVORAK Keyboard layout for Mac OS Catalina for transliterating Arabic into Latin

## The relevant problem
- Many standard Arabic romanization systems require the use of characters that are not on any keyboard layouts that come with the most popular operating systems. (For example see the symbols used for the characters hamza (هَمْزَةٌ), and ain (عَيْنٌ)). 
The solution: make a keyboard layout for Arabic romanization specifically.


## About the files
- The file titled "DVORAK_AR_Rom.keylayout" allows you to type ISO-233 characters using the dot/full-stop and underscore as dead keys. It includes at least one character not part of the standard, and is missing a few characters needed for alif.
- The file titled "DVORAK_AR_RomMa.keylayout" is for typing Arabic in Latin characters and is not according to any standard, but simply an attempt at making a Romanization for Arabic inspired by Maltese orthography.
